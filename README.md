# Transhift

A tiny and simple peer-to-peer file mover.

### Quick Start

To download and install, run:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/transhift/transhift/master/install.sh | bash
```

Or run each command individually from the [install script](https://github.com/transhift/transhift/blob/master/install.sh).

To test it out, run `transhift --version` and you should see `Transhift version 0.1.0`.
